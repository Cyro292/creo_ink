# SketchBoard - A collaborative web-platform for creativity and idea sharing
## About SketchBoard
Sketchbaord is an intuitive web-platform that enables people to collaborate with others and share ideas on a tool-rich sketchboard where the creativity is endless. Use Sketchboard to brainstorm, collaborate with others, or just have fun tinkering; whatever the goal, Sketchboard has the tools to achieve it, the possibilites are endless!

And the best part? It's completely free!

Sketchboard was created with classrooms in mind, which is why intuitiveness, ease of access, and security are our top priorities:<br>
• After just 30 seconds of familiarization, anyone can get started with sketching, etching and concepting to their heart's delight. But for those wanting to take a more in-depth dive into the tools we provide, or if you just want to find out more about Sketchboard and how to use it, you can do so here (add when implemented). <br>
• Sketchboard also has an easy-to-use permissions system, where owners can set and change the permissions of the user of a board, making Sketchboard ideal for classrooms, and even work environments.

• Even cooler, you don't even have to sign up to use Sketchboard; you can just sign in using a temporary username and get sketching, although creating an account does give you access to even more cool stuff ;). This feature is especially useful for spontaneously and easily setting up shared sketchboards for larger groups, like in classrooms (think [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/)).

• But most important, Sketchboard was built, from inception to sketching powerhouse, using only the best of what modern web security has to offer and a strict data protection policy, which makes Sketchboard the perfect tool for classrooms, work teams, and hopeless creatives around the globe, to safely collaborate and create, without having to worry about their information's safety or nefaaaarious third parties stealing their data. Find out more about our web security and data policy here (insert link when implemented).

## What is this GitHub repository and why is it here?
Well, there are lots of reasons!<br>
For one, Github allows for us to have a much more direct connection to our community, which is extremely important to us as it provides insights into how Sketchboard is being used, and, because we love interacting with so many talented and creative individuals; it inspires us so continute and to make Sketchboard even better than it already is.<br>
For a(more cheeky) 'nother, frankly, we know that there are some amazingly talented programmers and people out there that are a whole lot better than us and who can help us improve Sketchboard's functionality and security even more. (lots of love fellow webdev nerds <3)<br>
But most importantly, we believe in transparency, which is why we think it's important that our project be open-source for all the world to see. (Please note, howver, that we cannot include every file for security reasons)
